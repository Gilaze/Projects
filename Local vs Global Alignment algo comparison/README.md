This Python script compares two fundamental bioinformatics algorithms for sequence alignment: global alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and local alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. The code first prompts the user to input two sequences. It then calculates and displays the optimal global alignment, which attempts to align the entire length of both sequences. Immediately after, it uses the same two sequences to find and display the best local alignment, which identifies the most similar sub-regions within them, ignoring the rest. For both methods, the output includes the alignment score and a visual representation of the aligned sequences, making it a direct comparison of how each algorithm handles the same input data.

Big thanks and shoutout to Professor Compeau @ Carnegie Mellon University for his guidance!
