Through this project involving a New York City Airbnb dataset, I was able to apply Pandas, Numpy, and SKLearn to predict AirBnB rental prices in New York. It begins by loading and cleaning the data, then conducts exploratory analysis by creating visualizations like boxplots, bar charts, and a geographical map to understand price distributions and patterns. After exploring the data, the script prepares it for modeling by converting categorical features like neighbourhood into a numerical format and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Finally, it trains a Linear Regression model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on the features and evaluates the model's accuracy by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test data.

The entire code can be run on VSCode after installing the appropriate libraries and will generate individual graphs as well.
