Hi! My name is Ethan Luke Kim, born and raised in Orange County, CA, and I am currently 
a freshman at UC Berkeley majoring in Data Science! I enjoy tackling tough algorithms 
with code, working with prediction models, and using data to make real-life decisions. 
Outside of academics, I enjoy sports such as skiing, tennis, go-kart racing, playing 
jazz piano, and flying kites. In the future, I hope to become a Data Scientist, ML Engineer, 
or Quant Researcher working with complex Machine Learning / Prediction Models.
